# Scientific Calculator Using C# Windows Forms

## Description: 
The Scientific Calculator is a Windows Forms application developed using C# that provides advanced mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic.

## Features: 

### Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Perform fundamental arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Utilize operators like +, -, *, and / to handle straightforward calculations. 

### Scientific Functions:
Sine (sin): Calculate the sine of an angle (in degrees). Cosine (cos): Compute the cosine of an angle (in degrees). Tangent (tan): Determine the tangent of an angle (in degrees). 

### Logarithm (log): 
Find the logarithm of a number to base 10. 

### User Interface:
A user-friendly graphical interface with a display textbox to show the input and result. Buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators, and scientific functions. Clear button (C) to reset the input and output. Equal button (=) to calculate the result based on the entered expression. 

### Calculation Logic:
Handles the input of numbers and operators sequentially. Evaluates mathematical expressions using standard order of operations. Converts angles from degrees to radians for trigonometric functions. 

### Validation and Error Handling:
Checks for valid input before performing calculations. Handles errors such as invalid mathematical operations or logarithms of non-positive numbers


# DataGridView Application

## Overview

This Windows Forms application demonstrates how to use a `DataGridView` control to dynamically add rows at runtime based on input from three text boxes. The application allows users to input data into the text boxes and add it to the `DataGridView` by clicking a button.

## Features

- **DataGridView**: Displays the added rows with data from the text boxes.
- **Text Boxes**: Provide input fields for the data to be added.
- **Add Row Button**: Adds a new row to the `DataGridView` with the values from the text boxes.
- **Clear Text Boxes**: Clears the text boxes after adding a row.
