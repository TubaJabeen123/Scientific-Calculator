Scientific Calculator Using C# Windows Forms Description: The Scientific Calculator is a Windows Forms application developed using C# that provides advanced mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic.

Features: Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Perform fundamental arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Utilize operators like +, -, *, and / to handle straightforward calculations. 

Scientific Functions:
Sine (sin): Calculate the sine of an angle (in degrees). Cosine (cos): Compute the cosine of an angle (in degrees). Tangent (tan): Determine the tangent of an angle (in degrees). 

Logarithm (log): 
Find the logarithm of a number to base 10. 

User Interface:
A user-friendly graphical interface with a display textbox to show the input and result. Buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators, and scientific functions. Clear button (C) to reset the input and output. Equal button (=) to calculate the result based on the entered expression. 

Calculation Logic:
Handles the input of numbers and operators sequentially. Evaluates mathematical expressions using standard order of operations. Converts angles from degrees to radians for trigonometric functions. 

Validation and Error Handling:
Checks for valid input before performing calculations. Handles errors such as invalid mathematical operations or logarithms of non-positive numbers
